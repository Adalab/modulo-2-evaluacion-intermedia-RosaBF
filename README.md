# Guess-the-number
This is a game created entirely with JavaScript. This was, actually, one of my first experiences with JS at the bootmacp!

The game consists of the program generating a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. 
The game gives clues as to whether the number it tries is too high or too low, 
and it counts the number of attempts. Until at the end the player hits the number.
At the top, the player enters a number and hits the Test button. Below, in the Track section, the following texts appear:
When the page starts: Write a number and hit Test.
When the player enters a number greater than the random number and clicks Test: Too high.
